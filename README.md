# Wordly
 * A CLI python game where the user has six chances to guess a five letter English word from the dictionary. 
 * If the word the user enters has letters:
    * In the correct position, those letters will be highlighted green.
    * Present in the incorrect position, those letters will be highlighted yellow.
    * Not present in the required word will not be highlighted.
 * Imported nltk and obtained a bunch of five letter words.
 * If the user fails to guess the word, the correct word is displayed.
